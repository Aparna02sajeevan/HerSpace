### Project Description

HerSpace is a holistic wellness platform designed specifically for women's mental health and personal development. It combines mood tracking, journaling, financial planning, career resources, and mindfulness activities in one secure, supportive environment. The platform uses modern web technologies to provide a professional, welcoming space where women can prioritize their well-being.

### The Problem Statement

**Challenge:** Women face unique, interconnected wellness challenges in today's fast-paced world, yet lack integrated solutions to address them comprehensively.

**Key Issues:**
1. **Mental Health Crisis:** According to global health reports, women experience depression and anxiety at 1.5-2x the rate of men, yet struggle to access timely support
2. **Financial Insecurity:** Women earn 15-20% less than men globally and face barriers to financial literacy and independence
3. **Career Stagnation:** Gender gaps persist in tech, leadership, and STEM fields, with women lacking accessible mentoring and resources
4. **Emotional Exhaustion:** Societal pressures create stress around appearance, relationships, and life milestones
5. **Fragmented Solutions:** 
   - Mental health apps lack financial planning features
   - Journaling apps don't track mood patterns
   - Career platforms ignore wellness integration
   - Emergency resources are scattered across multiple platforms
6. **Privacy & Design Concerns:** Many wellness apps feel clinical rather than supportive; many lack a design philosophy centered on women's experiences

**Research Background:** Studies show that integrated wellness platforms increase user engagement by 40% and mental health outcomes by 30% compared to isolated tools.
